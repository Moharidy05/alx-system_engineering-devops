# The script is a basic process management script that starts, stops, or restarts the manage_my_process process based on the command-line argument provided.
# In the script:

# If the script is called with the argument "start", it executes ./manage_my_process in the background, creates a PID file (/var/run/my_process.pid), writes the PID of the process to the PID file, and displays a message indicating that the process has started.
# If the script is called with the argument "stop", it displays a message indicating that the process has stopped, kills the process by reading its PID from the PID file, and removes the PID file.
# If the script is called with the argument "restart", it performs the same steps as the "stop" operation, followed by the "start" operation.
# If the script is called without any arguments or with an unrecognized argument, it displays a usage message.
